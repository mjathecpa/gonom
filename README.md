# gonom
 A bulk file rename utility in go

 GONOM is a tool to efficiently perform bulk file rename functions.

This is currently a Windows-only utility however cross-platform use is intended in future updates.

The program runs in a terminal and will use the Windows common file dialogue to assist in file/folder selection.

Current options:
Change File Extension:
Set extension to find (case sensitive) and the new extension.  Select folder to walk through and have changes applied.
Note: new extension will be made lower case.
